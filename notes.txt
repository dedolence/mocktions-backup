    Just deleted everything after working on it all day. Too many errors. Learning new frameworks is so frustrating because at this point at a conceptual, abstract level, I know exactly what
    I need to do, but the syntax doesn't allow me to just whip it up. Wish this was in any other language, but I have no love for the "friendly" syntax of Python.

    The models had become congested and complicated - which ultimately they kinda need to be! At one point I added a timestamp field to a model. Persistant issues with default values where
    the field wasn't explicitly created as a nullable field (which that alone I suppose I can understand, but the error message insisted that it couldn't handle this because of a conflict with
    existing rows BUT THERE WERE NO ROWS IT WAS A BRAND NEW TABLE). so i set a default value as 0. then got a value error because 0 isn't the kinda default value a datetime field expected. 
    fair enough. delete the field to try again but i kept getting the error. deleted the entire model class. still getting it. loaded the database into sqlite, DROPPED THE TABLE, 


                            STILL
                            GETTING
                            THE
                            ERROR
    
    somehow it was still coming up with a malformatted default datetime value even after the table had been manually dropped from the entire g'damn database.

    since i was still in the beginning, i let my frustration take over and started over from scratch. clearly i need to build things up from simpler basics.

    it turns out the problem i was experiencing regarding using foreignkeys on a model before the foreignkey class has been defined is known but has an easy solution; simply encase the
    class name in '' as a string; officially supported by Django docs, seemingly not a hack.
    (the datetime error i've no idea)

So once again:
    - Create new listing:
        - Title
        - Description
        - Starting bid
        - Images
        - Category
    - Close listing
        - Adds message for winner
    - (Delete listing - not actually required)
    - Add comments to listings
    - Add/remove listings to watchlist
    - Bid on item
    - Watchlist page
    - Categories page
    - Django admin page

    DB Structure:
    Listings:   ID    title             description       starting_bid(FK)    current_bid(FK)    winning_bid(FK)   user_id(FK)   winner_id(FK)   category_id(FK)    timestamp
    Bids:       ID    amount            listing_id(FK)    user_id(FK)    timestamp
    (Watchlist:  ID    listing_id(FK)    user_id(FK))
    Comments:   ID    content           listing_id(FK)    user_id(FK)    timestamp
    Categories: ID    content
    Listings_   ID    listing_id(FK)    category_id(FK)
        Categories:

    User class now has a watchlist field that is many-to-many with Listings.
    
    The specifications require a table for Bids, which I suppose makes sense, but a scaled-up version of this should probably archive bids somewhere else as that table would probably
    get huge quickly. I guess that goes for many tables, so I wonder how archival works.

    I guess all these html layouts just implicitly get access to user...

    TODO: active listings should be accessed via category; URI looks like /category/listing_id
        /listings           - show all listings
        /listings/3         - show specific listing with id=3
        /categories         - show all categories
        /categories/books   - show all listings in the book category

        switch to trello boards for further dev

        coming back to this and figuring out what's going wrong has been a chore. but basically what i did last time i worked on this was change the way listings are included
        via a template, and that's cascaded across a few other templates. before, i included a template with a loop to generate each listing; then changed it so that the loop
        happens in the parent template, and the included template is for a single listing. i don't know if there's any better way to do it, but it was simplified so i'll stick
        with what i changed.

        however, this leads to another question. index.html should display the user's page when they are logged in (a login redirect otherwise). the question is whether to
        rerout to a users/<name> rout, or use index.html to generate the user's page. i'm leaning towards index.html being a specific home user page that can include options
        that otherwise wouldn't appear on a users/<name> rout. 

        simply CANNOT get {% url 'view_user' listing.user %} to work within the listing_block.html template. "listing.user" DOES work when the url is removed, so this template
        very definitively has access both to listing and listing.user property. simply {% url 'view_user' %} has no route attached to it.

        workaround that may have to suffice. not using {% url %}, but instead "hard-coding" in <a href="users/{{ listing.user }}">. i'd so much rather use {% url %} because the
        route to "users/" could change. 

    11/21
        better workaround is to send along an additional username variable so that i don't have to access the user property of the listing with the dot notation, which is
        what i think is causing the issue.

        for the sake of getting this project done, i am going to cancel image upload as a feature. with the way django works i would feel more comfortable doing a separate test
        project to get a feel for how django does it. for now it seems just outside the scope of the project (and the project rubrik not only doesn't require it but does require
        a link to a media url instead).

        new listing path:
            create_listing:
                if GET: display form for new listing
                if POST: validate form, render form for preview, POST either back to create_listing or to submit_listing

        A lot has happened, trying to document more in Trello than here. But now it's clear I need to refactor the models somewhat, to take advantage of Django's builtin
        through table functions via ManyToMany fields. For some reason I am finding this conceptually very difficult to grasp. I understand this:
            User and Listing relate in two ways.
            1) A Listing has a Single owner. One User has many Listings. One-to-Many.
            2) A Listing may have several Watchers. One Watcher may be watching several Listings. Many-to-Many.
        The Listing-to-Owner relationship seems straightforward, a ForeignKey field.
        Parsing the M2M field seems more difficult. I think part of the problem is understanding whether what I want is possible, nevermind implementing it.
        What I want:
            user = Users.objects.get(id=X)
            users_watchlist = user.watchlist.all() -> QuerySet of all the Listings that the user is watching.
            users_listings = user.listings.all() -> QuerySet of all the listings that the user owns.
        and/or:
            listing = Listings.objects.get(id=X)
            listings_watchers = listing.watchers.all() -> QuerySet of all the Users that are watching this listing.
            listings_owner = listing.owner.get() -> A single instance of a User who owns this listing.
        
        I *have* accomplished the latter, I think, by adding a M2M field to the Listing model. I was able to add a user to a listing's watchers field
        by calling:
            listing.watchers.add(user)
        Then if I call:
            listings.watchers.all()
        It produces a QuerySet that includes the user. Ultimately though I think the reverse will be more useful since everything sort of revolves around
        the request.user object. Therefore being able to call user.watchlist.all() and user.listings.all() will be very convenient.

        I don't know why this was so hard. Leave any sort of "watching" field off of Listing; just keep the ForeignKey field "owner".
        Simply have a M2M field called "watchlist" on User. No related_names seem to even be necessary here.
        Just do: user.watchlist.add(listing), or user.watchlist.all(). Why was this so difficult?

    A little bit lost at the moment and wish I had been taking notes earlier. I started working on a feature - uploading images to a listing? - and
    it has spiraled somewhat. Images initiated a refactoring of the AJAX process. That worked out well and I think I have a more robust system in 
    place. Now I'm back to the listing creation/editing/posting loop. What needs to happen?
    - Create listing: 
        - Initially create a temporary listing. Why? So that the images have a listing ID to be attached to. They are uploaded before the listing is
        posted, so they need to have some ID to identify them. This also allows the Listings to be saved as a draft and edited/posted later. 
        - At some point, that temporary listing will become active. How? I think it makes sense to have an active/inactive boolean flag. Why?
        So that if the database gets large, inactive listings can be archived easily.
    - Edit listing:
        - Continue editing a draft listing, or a posted listing. If a posted listing, all fields will be required for the changes to take effect.
    - Post listing:
        - Check that all fields are entered and flag the listing as active.

    It occurs to me that the Listing model class should have some more functionality built into it:
    - Active/inactive flag (boolean field, default False because initially Listings will always be drafts)
    - Listing.temp_listings.all(): a model manager that returns only draft listings.
    - Listing.active_listings.all(): a model manager that returns only posted listings.
    - Listing.objects.all(): default manager returns all listings.
    
    When a listing is queried, it should also by default return a list of images, right? Because those are very much required in rendering Listings.
    But also, how difficult would it be to just use, listing_images = listing_object.images.all()

    So what do I want a Listing.objects.get(pk=XX) query to look like?

    Beginning to think I literally don't have to do any of this.

    I decided to merge Listing and TempListing into Listing. Added:
    active = a True/False flag to indicate whether this listing is a draft or not
    is_expired = a True/False property that says whether or not the listing is expired or not.
    expiration = returns a dict containing information about when the listing expires (still maybe better to calculate this at the time 
        it's rendered to the user).
    all_images = a property that returns a QuerySet containing the UserImage objects associated with the listing.
        Why? Avoids having to do a separate query for the images, which would need to be sent as another context variable to a template.
        Not a big deal perhaps, but it keeps the logic of fetching a listing's images neatly tucked into the Listing class itself.

    Revamp creation process again:
    Preview and edit are identical: they both render a listing and a form for editing it, and lead to either posting it 
    or saving it as a draft.
