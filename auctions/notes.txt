The listing creation loop:

1) View: create_listing
- produces a blank form with no field requirements and returns it with a template.

2) View: preview_listing
- creates an instance of the form using POST data.
- saves this instance as a new row in DB (its "active" field is automatically false, indicating it is a temporary listing)
- collects a list of database IDs corresponding to any images uploaded via a hidden select/option field in the form.
- gets instances of all these images and sets their listing foreignkey field to match the temporary listing.
- returns the form and images to a template for any final changes

3) View: submit_listing
(done) TODO: figure out how to access the temporary listing
    - set some attribute in the template. to prevent someone forging a different listing ID,
    make sure to check that the listing's owner matches the session user.
(done) TODO: create a form* and bind it with POST data and setting the instance to the temporary listing
(done) TODO: check to see if it's valid, save and redirect to its page if so; error else.
(done) TODO: set foreignkey of any new image added in the preview stage to point to the listing
* using a different form that does have requirements for all fields.

    Making a generic include for an imagethumbnail.
    - read as a string when uploading a new image to a listing creat/edit: mode "edit"
    - included in for loop by view listing: mode "view"
    - edit mode: click to open a modal with edit controls
    - view mode: click to open a modal with no edit controls
    - generic modal:
        - same flags
        - include
        - createListing.html and editListing.html will include it with edit flag
        - viewListing.html will include it with view flag.
